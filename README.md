LetterPushGame is a simple console based game built in C++ for windows.

## Rules

The game starts with a grid of characters on the screen, there are 3 kinds:

- **Obstacles** which you can't move, can't go over and generally they do nothing. (#)
- **Letters** simple letters from the alphabet, these can be pushed anywhere on the grid plane.
- **Player** the only character you can move and push the letters with. (@)

Your task is to move all the letters on the plane in a way that they spell out the original word.

For example "a# bc" is not correct but "abc" is.
